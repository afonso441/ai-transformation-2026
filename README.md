# 🚀 AI Transformation Journey

**From Embedded Systems Engineer → AI Engineer**

## About This Project

After 7+ years of C/C++ embedded development, I'm pivoting to AI engineering over the next 14 months. This repository documents every step.

## Month 1: Python AI Fundamentals

### Week 1: Python Basics + Claude API (In Progress)

**Focus:** Environment setup, basic Python, first API calls

**Progress This Week:**

✅ **Day 1 Complete:**
- Environment setup (Python 3.11+, VS Code, virtual environment)
- Anthropic SDK installation and configuration
- API key setup (.env file)
- First successful Claude API call (`day1_hello_claude.py`)
- Experimentation with different prompts (`day1_experiment.py`)
- Environment verification (`test_setup.py`)

✅ **Day 2 Complete:**
- Completed DeepLearning.AI Prompt Engineering (Lessons 1-2)
- Production error handling with exponential backoff
- Prompt engineering experiments (vague vs specific)
- 5 total scripts now

✅ **Day 3 Complete:**
- Learned system prompts (AI behavior customization)
- Built embedded systems code reviewer
- Built hardware documentation assistant
- Created custom AI assistant for my specific work needs
- 8 total scripts now

**Files Created:**
- `day1_hello_claude.py` - First API integration
- `day1_experiment.py` - Prompt testing
- `test_setup.py` - Environment verification
- `day2_error_handling.py` - Retry logic with backoff ✨
- `day2_prompt_experiments.py` - Prompt quality comparison ✨
- `day3_system_prompt_demo.py` - Understanding system prompts ✨
- `day3_code_reviewer.py` - AI code reviewer for embedded C ✨
- `day3_hardware_docs_assistant.py` - Hardware Q&A expert ✨

**Key Learnings:**
- Error handling patterns (retry + exponential backoff)
- Specific prompts with context = 10x better results
- Prompt engineering is like optimizing code - details matter
- System prompts = AI initialization/configuration
- Can create domain-specific AI experts
- One system prompt can transform generic AI into specialized tool
- These assistants are actually useful for real work!

**Remaining This Week:**
- [ ] Days 4-7: More practical tools and experiments
- [ ] Complete DeepLearning.AI course
- [ ] Week 1 summary by Sunday
