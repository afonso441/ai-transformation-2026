## Month 1: Python AI Fundamentals

### Week 1: Python Basics + Claude API (In Progress)

**Focus:** Environment setup, basic Python, first API calls

**Progress This Week:**

✅ **Day 1 Complete:**
- Environment setup (Python 3.11+, VS Code, virtual environment)
- Anthropic SDK installation and configuration
- API key setup (.env file)
- First successful Claude API call (`day1_hello_claude.py`)
- Experimentation with different prompts (`day1_experiment.py`)
- Environment verification (`test_setup.py`)

**Files Created:**
- `day1_hello_claude.py` - First API integration
- `day1_experiment.py` - Testing different prompts and parameters
- `test_setup.py` - Verify environment configuration
- `.env` - API key storage (gitignored)
- `requirements.txt` - Project dependencies

**What I Learned:**
- Claude API structure (models, messages, tokens)
- Python virtual environments
- Environment variable management
- Basic prompt engineering concepts

**Remaining This Week:**
- [ ] Continue building Python scripts with Claude API
- [ ] Practice error handling and retries
- [ ] Experiment with system prompts
- [ ] Build useful automation scripts
- [ ] Complete Week 1 by Sunday
